Account
    Use AJAX response to display proper elements for form
    Domain should probably be moved to the database
All
    Make sure attempted change in database matches user's ID to avoid
    changes made in the HTML data property
Night theme
User controls via GUI - need differentiation between all and just yourself - see above point
    Some accounts shared, such as pepband, so password can't be changed
        have boolean as part of table?
    Domain shouldn't be changeable, except by root(/other admins?)
Images for other services
Write other services
Handle resize of window more gracefully, somehow?
